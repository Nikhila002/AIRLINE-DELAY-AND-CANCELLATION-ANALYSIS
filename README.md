# AIRLINE-DELAY-AND-CANCELLATION-ANALYSIS
In the fast-paced world of air travel, airlines must handle delays and cancellations. The project explores a complex dataset from Kaggle with 28 features and 5.81M instances describing diverse aspects of flight information crucial in determining the performance and reliability of air transportation.

## Data
The dataset under consideration comprises diverse features that capture crucial aspects of airline operations and performance.
Time-related variables, such as scheduled departure and arrival times, actual departure and arrival times, and associated delays, offer an overall understanding of temporal dynamics in flight schedules.
Specific information related to aircraft, such as carrier details, flight numbers, and diversion indicators, helps identify distinctive patterns for different carriers and instances of unexpected route changes.
Metrics indicating operational efficiency, like taxi times and elapsed times, provide insights into the effectiveness of ground operations and the total duration of flights.
Moreover, the dataset details geospatial information, including the origin and destination airports and other influential factors such as the regional weather conditions.
The classifications for delays, for example, carrier delay, weather delay, and late aircraft delay offer a detailed breakdown of delay factors which enable a detailed analysis of the underlying causes behind disruptions in airline schedules.

## Research Question and Objectives:
The primary aim of this research initiative is to delve into the intricate dynamics of historical airline data, unravel the underlying patterns, and identify the multifaceted factors that contribute to delays and cancellations in air travel.

By thoroughly studying the dataset, we aim to answer the following questions:
1. What are the main causes of flight delays and cancellations?
2. How do flight delays vary by airline, airport, and time of day?
3. What scheduling strategies could airlines adopt to reduce delays?
4. Can we develop a predictive model to anticipate flight delays and cancellations?
5. How do airline-specific operational strategies influence delay management?
